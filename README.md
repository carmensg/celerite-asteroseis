# Joint Asteroseismology and Transit Analysis Codes

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/104820986.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/104820986)

Python codes to perform transit fitting and basic time-domain asteroseismology using Gaussian process regression through [dfm/celerite](www.github.com/dfm/celerite/) with [mrtommyb/ktransit](www.github.com/mrtommyb/ktransit/). A description of Gaussian process regression can be found at [www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml](www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml). Details of the model are described in [Grunblatt et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05865), please cite this paper when using this code.

See GPasteroseis.ipynb for example usage.
